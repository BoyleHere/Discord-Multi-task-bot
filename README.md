# Discord-Multi-task-bot
A bot I made for my Discord server with help from ggelango.
This bot can verify email from a specific user in discord when they want to join the server.
I have added some things like: when user messages F, the bot replies with 'F' just for fun purposes.
If you want you can implement this code in your bot but you will need the following to do so:
1) A Sendgrid account
2) An email account from which you want your mail to be sent
3) Optionally you can add a mailgun account incase sendgrid does not work.
Yep that is all folks!
`PS to use the sendgrid and mailgun API refer to their API page because I coded it on repl.it and didn't need to do pip install thingy :)`
